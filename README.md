## Overview
A simple site I created to play around with simple Javascript logic and some front-end development.

Try it out at [randompasswordgenerator.io](https://random-password-generator.io/)

## Background and Motivation

I found that I was often prompted to come up with complex password combinations when creating new accounts for on various sites. I decided to create my own simple web app that randomly generated a password as well as a helpful mneumonic to help in remembering the password. 

To enhance the functionality, I plan to configure a pipeline that can call one of the Text-to-Image APIs to produce a unique image with the password string.

## Goals

1. Deploy a web application for password generation.
2. Configure a pipeline that can use a Text-to-Image model to produce a unique image based the password.

## Practical Applications

- Help individuals quickly create and remember complex passwords

## Milestones

### :white_check_mark: Phase 1 :
Develop the web app to randomly generate passwords based on custom parameters

### :white_square_button: Phase 2 :
Configure a pipeline that can call one of the Text-to-Image model APIs to produce a custom image for each ranomly generated password.
